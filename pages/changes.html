    <h1 class="text">Anti Copy Paster (Python) Fall 2023 Research</h1>
    <h3 class="text">This is the documentation site for our research to extend the functionality of PyCharm to include the AntiCopyPaster tool.</h3>
    <p class="text">
      We have developed Anti Copy Paste Plugin Python, a Python plugin which detects when the user copies and pastes 
      a section of their own code and refactors the software to minimize repetition.
      <br><br>
      So, given a set of parameters, the plugin determines if the pasted code should be flagged for refactoring, notifies the user
      with the option to approve refactoring and then performs said refactoring by replacing duplicate code sections with calls 
      to a newly created method. 
      <br><br>
      This has been achieved through studying and adapting a Java based plugin for IntelliJ IDEA previously created by another group of Seniors.
      Our plugin functions as a port of this plugin with major adaptations to recognize and refactor Python.
      <br><br>
      Alongside the plugin, the project involves the creation of this website which functions not only as a repository for information on our project for the client to review, 
      but also as a source of information for any users experiencing issues as well as possible later groups who wish to further develop our plugin.
